# To-Do List

## High-priority tasks

- Save microphone images. 
- Save each channel separately. 
- Ensure simulation reproducibility against the --split value change. 


## Backlog

- Add other RIR generation engines.
    - pyroomacoustics
    - Hakan's TF-based room simulation tool. 
- Supporting other data sets, like WSJ0/1. 
- Partitioning the original train set into train/validation. 


## Finished

- Add dev/eval simulation. 
- Expose more control parameters. 
- Add MD5 chucksum validation.
